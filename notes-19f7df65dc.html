Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.<br><br>Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.<br><br>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.<br><br>There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.</p></div></div><script>!function(e,a,t,n,g,c){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e.ga||(e.ga=function(){(e.ga.q=e.ga.q||[]).push(arguments)}),e.ga.l=+new Date,g=a.createElement(t),c=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],g.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",c.parentNode.insertBefore(g,c)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create"," UA-61575797-1"),ga("send","pageview")</script></body></html>
